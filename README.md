This HTML page is a simple multilingual web introduction hosted on a Synology NAS. Here's a breakdown of the page structure and functionality:

### Purpose
- The page serves to introduce a web service hosted on a Synology NAS (`sacenpapier.synology.me`) and provide information about the user's projects and portfolio.
- It offers content in both English and French, which users can toggle using a button.

### Page Structure
1. **Head Section**:
   - Sets character encoding to UTF-8.
   - Ensures responsiveness with a viewport meta tag.
   - Includes a title ("Deploy Project Introduction").
   - Defines internal CSS for styling the page, making it visually appealing and mobile-friendly.

2. **Body Section**:
   - **Container Div**: Central area that contains the main content, styled to appear as a centered, white box with rounded corners.
   - **Button**: Positioned at the top right of the container, it toggles between English (default) and French content. Initially labeled "FR" to switch to French.
   - **English Content (`div#en`)**: 
     - A title (`h1`) featuring the NAS service name.
     - Several paragraphs explaining the web service's purpose, a link to the portfolio, and a prompt for users to stay tuned for updates.
   - **French Content (`div#fr`)**: 
     - Similar content as the English version but in French. This section is initially hidden using a `hidden` class.
   - **Logo**: An image in a circular container (`div.icon-circle`) at the bottom of the container, representing the Deploy initiative.

### Features
- **Language Toggle Button**: The button switches the displayed language between English and French. Clicking the button hides the currently visible content and displays the alternative language content. The button's text also updates to indicate the available language option.
- **Responsive Design**: The CSS includes media queries to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes. Text sizes, margins, and padding adjust for mobile screens, ensuring readability and a pleasant user experience.
  
### JavaScript Functionality
- The script adds an event listener to the toggle button. It checks the current language being displayed, switches between showing and hiding the English and French content, and changes the button label accordingly.

### CSS Styling
- Uses a neutral color palette with a light gray background for the body and white for the content container.
- Sets the font family to a sans-serif type for a clean and modern look.
- Utilizes flexbox for the container and icon to center the content and manage layout efficiently.
- The `.icon-circle` class styles the logo as a centered, circular image container.

### Overall Impression
This page provides a clean and functional interface to introduce a web service. The language toggle feature enhances accessibility for both English and French-speaking users. The responsive design ensures it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
